  describes the traditional way to do it when starting out.

All musical instruments need to be tuned on a regular basis. This is true for 
guitars, [but also for pianos, harps, violins, etc.][other-instruments]. Every 
single guitar string is under a certain tension that ranges from 6 to 10 kg 
(pounds?), and that energy tends to dissipate over time, making the guitar out 
of tune.

On top of that, humidity and temperature variations have an influence on wood 
and make it swell or shrink, which also leads to small changes in the 
instruments's setup. This is why a guitar should *always* be tuned before it's 
played.

## A440

A440 is a reference pitch used by all musicians and available on all tuners. It 
is also the note given by most [tuning forks][tuning-fork] when they're hit and 
start to ring.

To tune a guitar string with such a reference, you have to turn the 
corresponding mechanic (the knob in which the string is eventually wrapped at 
the top of the neck) so that the note A on the string matches the external 
reference. This might be hard to do when starting out, this is why I would 
advise to consider [getting a tuner][which-tuner-should-i-buy]. But it is 
important to understand the process.

## A guitar's strings

The vast majority of guitars use six strings that are tuned in a standard E 
tuning. Each string set is made out of three low strings, and three high 
strings. The lowest string is E, which means that when it is played without any 
left hand fretting ('open'), the note produced is an E. Here's the list of the 
strings in the same order as on your guitar:

- low E
- A
- D
- G
- B
- high E

## The notes on the neck

Once any note on your guitar is aligned with A440 (the A at the 5th fret of the 
high E string for instance), then all the string will be in tune, no matter 
whether you're playing a D at the 10th fret, a C# at the 9th fret, or an F at 
the first fret. You'll therefore be able to use this string as a reference to 
tune other strings against, the same way you used A440 as a reference to tune 
the first string.

## La méthode classique

The classical approach is indeed exactly about tuning the A on the 5th fret of 
the high E string with a reference A. Then, the high E string is played open, 
and it should sound the same as the E at 5th fret of the B string.

Once the B string is in tune, it should be played open and compared to the B at 
the 4th fret of the G string:

Now let's play the open G string and match that to the G at the 5th fret of the 
D string:

Next, let's match the D on the 5th fret of the A string with the open D string:

Finally, let's match the note A on the 5th fret of the E string with the open A 
string:

## Any question?

Congratulations, you now know how to tune a guitar! Although it can be 
frustrating for a guitar beginner, it is an excellent exercise in order to 
improve your musical ear. To tune faster and with more precision, you can look 
into [purchasing a tuner][which-tuner-should-i-buy].
