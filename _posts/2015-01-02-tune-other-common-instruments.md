Although mostly guitar players visit this website, the tuner can be used with 
most other common instruments. Here are a few possible variations of Tune That 
Guitar.

## Tune a bass

A bass guitar's tuning is the same as that of a guitar. There are two 
differences, though. The first is that the bass guitar, as its name implies, is 
an instrument whose range is low. It might therefore be more difficult for the 
tuner to pick up exactly which note is being played, and you might have to use 
your ear to polish the tuning after you use the tuner. Especially on the low 
strings.

The second difference is that a regular bass guitar only has four strings while 
a guitar generally has six. E standard tuning (EADGBe) therefore becomes 
*EADG*: the same tuning as on a guitar, minus the two high strings.

## Tune a ukulele

Like on guitars or bass guitars, mechanics at the top of the ukulele neck are 
used to tune each individual string. The ukulele standard tuning is *GCEA*. The 
main difference with a guitar's tuning is that G, the first string, is higher 
than C and E; unlike the guitar where strings go from low to high. This ukulele 
tuning is called *re-entrant tuning*, and it is the standard, but there are 
also different options depending on the style and tunes you're looking to play.

## Tune a violin or cello

Producing a pleasant sound out of a violin is not something that's easy to 
achieve, especially when the violin's not in tune! This is again a matter of 
tweaking the mechanics. Except there might be two per string on a violin: one 
on the neck, but another at the bridge. If you're only going to do a small 
change, then use the knob at the bridge. For larger changes, use the mechanics 
on the neck. Do not put too much pressure, though, or the string might just 
break! The notes that you're looking for are **GDAE** for the violin and 
**CGDA** for the cello.

## Tune a piano

It is generally a bad idea for somebody who doesn't have past experience with 
the instrument to try to tune a piano on his own. Although the pitch is also a 
matter of strings under pressure, upright and grand pianos are way more complex 
to handle. First of all, a dedicated tool is required to twist the mechanics. 
But then, it is not only six strings you're looking at, but 88 notes, with one 
to three strings per note! It might even be, depending on the piano's 
condition, that it would be impossible to get it to match A440 in one try, and 
that it would have to be done in multiple smaller steps. This is the reason why 
professional piano technicians learn the job in school and charge for their 
service. They have an experimented ear and can feel how the instrument's going 
to react.
