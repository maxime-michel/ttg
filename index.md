Using your computer, tablet or smartphone's microphone, this online tuner works 
like a regular electronic tuner. To get started, simply click on the bottom 
left banner, and then grant the browser access to the microphone (see <a 
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR9re874Sik" 
target="_blank">tutorial</a>).

Please make sure that if you're going to be tuning an electric guitar, it 
should either be amplified or plugged into your device so that the tuner can 
figure out what notes are being played.

As the page ['Tuning a guitar for dummies'][dummies] explains, the notes that 
you should see on the tuner, from the lowest string to the thinnest, are: **E, 
A, D, G, B, E**.

## Buy a dedicated tuner to save time

I would however suggest to [buy a dedicated 
tuner][which-guitar-tuner-should-i-buy]. The model I recommend is the clip 
tuner [Korg PC-2 Pitchclip][korg-pc2]. Here's why:

- you won't need your smartphone or computer anymore,
- the tuner can stayÂ on the guitar,
- you'll be able to tune even in noisy environments,
- in one word, it'll be faster.

## Tune by ear using audio files for individual strings

Here are also recordings of each individual string in standard E tuning. Using 
them, you could start tuning your guitar by ear, which is excellent practice.
